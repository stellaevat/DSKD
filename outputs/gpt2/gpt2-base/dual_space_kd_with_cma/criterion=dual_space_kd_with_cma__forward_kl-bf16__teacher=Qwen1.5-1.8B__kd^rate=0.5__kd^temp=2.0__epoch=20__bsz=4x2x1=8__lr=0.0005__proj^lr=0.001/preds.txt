Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?<n><n>### Response:<n>		One theory has to do with the increase of popularity of film and television roles. There are several reasons that many US Hollywood films are made in the state ofGeorgia.  The largest is the Godfather.  The other two films, like the Godfather Part 2 and the Pulp Fiction, were made in the state of North Carolina in the late 70’s.  While these films were generally considered the largest of the American films, their popularity is largely dependent on the state of Georgia.  Georgia is home to a diverse set of film companies including, Union Square, and The Godfather Part 2.  The Godfather Part 3 also was made in Georgia after it was made a few years prior.  The Godfather became the first US movie to produce two Oscar-winning films, in 1942 and 1947.  This success was the largest success of the Civil War and also a cultural phenomenon.  The film is a subject of critical and commercial success as well as a large cultural phenomenon.  The state of Georgia is politically moderately conservative and tends to be a conservative, even at the state level.  The Tea Party movement in Georgia is a natural fit for this demographic, and it is likely due to the fact that most of the film is made in Georgia.

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The most important point is to practice as a game coach.  Start with the fundamentals by repeatedly bringing the ball to your set point without the ball.

Once you are on that point you want to move your feet away from the basket and into the "out basket."  If you can move your feet away from basket and make the shot, you are now "involved in making the shot".  This is a great position to be in when you begin shooting layups.  Gradually you will need to drop the ball and get into the "out basket".  Once you are on your "out basket" you are almost ready to shoot the ball.  This is how advanced your basketball is handling ball.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How is data engineering different from data science?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Data Engineering occurs before data science in the data lifecycle. Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.<n>Data Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle
